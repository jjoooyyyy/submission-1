        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Joy. I currently am a student at Massey Univercity in Wellington, working towards a degree in design. I mainly focused around illustration but this year, taking screen has forced me to go out of my comfort zone and approach more photography based design.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is going to display the work i have from the time around in highschool and Univercity(2023-2021). A lot of my work hasnt been displayed here because I've lost access to it.
